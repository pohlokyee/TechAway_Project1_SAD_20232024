In these fast-paced times, an efficient document management system (DMS) has become essential for every organization. An efficient DMS can significantly reduce the time required for document handling. However, some government agencies, such as Lembaga Kemajuan Pertanian Kemubu (KADA), still face challenges with their DMS. 

 

KADA representative Mr. Ahmad Rohailan Bin Hani stated that the agency still relies on the physical method of using physical forms for its document management. This leads to low efficiency and higher time consuming for users. Additionally, the current DMS lacks comprehensive reporting features necessary for conduct decision-making. As a result, the organization struggles to process documents efficiently and adapt to rapid changes in the information storage. The reliance on physical forms also increases the risk of document loss and makes data retrieval cumbersome. 

 

Mr. Ahmad Rohailan Bin Hani aims to enhance the current DMS to accelerate document processing and improve efficiency. Moreover, for the organization's better development, he hopes to integrate features such as a robust reporting system to facilitate decision-making. By implementing these improvements, KADA can streamline operations, reduce manual workload, and provide better services to its member.
